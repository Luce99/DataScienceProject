Colombia is the first country in the world with the most variety of bird species and we believe bird watching tourism could help the country to grow in terms of economy, tourism and environment. The mision of this Project is to offer a data science solution that could help people and government institutions to take advantage of bird watching tourism to improve local economies using this solution to make decisions.
